# bike_trips_analysis
In this project, we will be using the Divvy bikes data sets. The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single data frame and then conduct simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do subscriber and customer riders use Divvy bikes differently?”
